# cppNotebooks
This repository contains all the necessary files to use Jupyter
Notebooks with C++

To create a Jupyter Notebook using C++(11, 14 or 17) just open this repository on 
mybinder.org (or conda or similar), choose new -> notebook -> C++.

Note: Launching the server using C++ kernel takes a bit longer than with Python
