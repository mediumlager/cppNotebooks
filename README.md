This repository contains all the necessary files to use Jupyter
Notebooks with C++

To create a Jupyter Notebook using C++(11, 14 or 17 at this moment 11.7.2018)
just open this repository on mybinder.org [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mediumlager/cppNotebooks/master) (Colab doesn't support C++, at least yet),
choose
```
new -> notebook -> C++
```
and you have a notebook that understands C++.

Note: Launching the server using C++ kernel takes a bit longer than with Python
